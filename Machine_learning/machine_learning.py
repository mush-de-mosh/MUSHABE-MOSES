'''Machine leaning ->Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to 
 learn and improve from experience without explicit programming.
 
 applications of machine learning
 1. Image Analysis
 2. Speech recognition
 3. Disease prediction
 4. Stock market analysis
 5. Fraud detection
 6. Recommendation Systems
 
 Types of Machine Learning
 1. Supervised learning --labelled dataset, structured
-> Most common algorithms in supervised learning
      - linear regression
      - logistic regression
      - Decision trees
      - Support vector Machines (SVM)
      - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
      - Random Forest (RF)
      - Deep learning (CNN) - image classification<===
      
 2. Unsupervised learning --unlabelled data, discovering hidden patterns in form of clusters, structures
 -> Most algorithms
      - k-means clustering
      - Hierarchical clustering
      - PCA (principle component Analysis)
      #model selection and validation
      
 3. Semi supervised learning
 
 4. Reinforcement learning-rewards
